    "    - Reading the input- This part takes O(N * S) since we are going over all candidate- N and for each one we go over all skills- S.  \n",
    "    As stated in the assignment the input has a total of 2+ N(S+1) lines\n",
    "    which implies reading the input is O(N * S).  \n",
    "    Creating the dictionary is also O(N * S) because: Checking if a key exists in a dictionary is O(1) and Updating a dictionary with the `update()` methode is also O(1).  \n",

    "    3. `find_best_candidates` - The len() function checks the number of items in a dictionary takes O(1).   The `sorted()` function which sorts the dictionary items has time complexity of O(n log n),   where n is the number of items in the dictionary and Since n <= M < N - we get O(N log N).  The keys() method returns a view object that displays a list of all keys in the dictionary this operation takes O(1). The [:num] operation slices the first `num` elements from the sorted list. This operation is O(k), where k is the number of elements being sliced.  Since K < M < N this operation takes O(1). So overall we get O(N log N).  \n",
    "    4. `calculate_skill_score`- The generator expression iterates over the list of candidates. This operation is O(n), where n is the number of candidates which we know is < M < N. the `sum` methode takes O(1) and therefore we get total running time of O(N).  \n",
    "    5. `check_benefit`- The dictionary comprehensions {k: v for k, v in skill1.items() if k != candidate} and {k: v for k, v in skill2.items() if k != candidate} each have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of items in the dictionary which is smaller than N. The function call `find_best_candidates` 4 times which takes O(4 * N log N) = O(N log N). The function also call `calculate_skill_score` 4 times which takes O(4 * N) = O(N). The comparison `score1 - score_copy1 > score2 - score_copy2` and the return statements have a constant time complexity, O(1).\n",
    "    Overall we get O(N log N).  \n",
    "    6. `calculate_score`- The for loop iterates over the items in the `selected_members` dictionary. This operation is O(n), where n is the number of items in the dictionary, since n < M < N we get O(N). The expression `candidates_skills[value][key]` accesses a value in a dictionary. Accessing a value in a dictionary by its key is an O(1) operation. So overall we get O(N).  \n",

The function call `check_benefit` for candidates who were selected and being selected now again. In the worst case this function will be called M(S-1) times which implies running time O(N(S-1)) * O(N log N). All other operations inside the for loop takes O(1) each. At the end we call the `calculate_score` function which has running time of O(N). So we get: O(N^2 log N) + O(N(S-1)) * O(N log N) + O(N) = O(S * N^2 log N).\n",
