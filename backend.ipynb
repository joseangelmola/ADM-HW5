The citation should represent the citation given from one paper to another. For example, if paper A has cited paper B, we should expect an edge from node A to B.\n",

    "The dataset is quite large and may not fit in your memory when you try constructing your graph. So, what is the solution? You should focus your investigation on a subgraph. You can work on the most connected component in the graph. However, you must first construct and analyze the connections to identify the connected components.\n",

    "Citation graph: only consider the citation relationship between these 10,000 papers and ignore the rest.\n",
